                         My current favorite class is Computer Science Capstone Honors, where I can work on creating programming projects,
                         such as this website! After High School, I plan on pursuing my passion for Computer Science in college,
                         where I can learn more about the fascinating world of Programming!</p>
                    
                        <p>Outside of school, I like to play video games. I play both casual and competitive, single-player and multiplayer games.
                         I also like to spend time with his friends and family. Whether I spend time alone or with others, 
                         you will always find me trying to find the fun in the simplest things!</p>

                        Pong Game is a recreation of the classic game Pong using Java. Everyone knows what Pong is,
                        but for those who have been sleeping under a rock for the last 50+ years,
                        Pong is a table tennisâ€“themed game where two players control a paddle and volley a ball,
                        trying to prevent the ball from hitting their side of the screen.</div>

                      Wealth Distribution Lab is a Java program that reads from a comma-separated value (.csv) file.
                      The .csv file contains data for many countries, a range of years, income deciles, mean income, and total population.
                      The program can output this data and even find the Gini Index for that country and year.</div>

                      A text-based adventure game is a classic genre where all information and interactions are displayed as text on the screen.
                      In this game, the player will be able to fight monsters, earn gold, and buy tools for combat.

                     This game was made following the Youtube tutorial made by Game Maker's Toolkit. If you somehow missed the hit mobile sensation,
                     Flappy Bird, it is a game where you control a bird and help it fly through obstacles.</div>

                      During the 2021-2022 competition season, I programmed the climb subsystem,
                      which utilizes Talon FX motors and was an essential part of the endgame for the 2022 season game Rapid React. 
                      During the 2022-2023 competition season, I helped program the autonomous pathways through utilizing PID loops and analyzing encoder data on Phoenix Tuner,
                      which allowed it to be one of the highest scoring during competitions.

                      To help prepare the newer software members of SO BOTZ, I have created several tutorials over the summer.
                      The drivetrain tutorial introduces members to FRC programming through teaching students how to code the drivetrain of the robot.
                      The tutorial offers both step-by-step instructions while also challenging students to come up with solutions to problems. 
                      The Awesome Software Guides provides students with useful and thorough guides for important applications.

                      Participating in Project Invent, SO Inventz created OZEE, an AI powered facial recognition system for attendance using a raspberry Pi and a touchscreen display.
                      OZEE is meant to solve the problem of tracking volunteers by making the process more efficient and secure. 
                      The team has won the $500 Moonshot award for identifying a notably novel and impactful idea. 
                      For those wondering, the name OZEE is a play on my nickname "OZ" and the school's nickname "TZ."

                He knew what he was supposed to do. That had been apparent from the beginning.
                That was what made the choice so difficult.
                What he was supposed to do and what he would do were not the same. 
                This would have been fine if he were willing to face the
